<p class="margin"> Mickey was co-founder of Moleculo and served as CEO until its acquisition by Illumina in December 2012. Prior to co-founding Moleculo, Mickey was a post-doc at Stanford University, where he developed novel methods for sequencing the genetic diversity of human viruses. He holds an M.Sc. in Computer Science from the Tel-Aviv University and a Ph.D. in Computational Biology from the Weizmann Institute of Science. His research was published in Cell (2007), Nature Genetics (2007), PNAS (2008), and Nature (2010). </p>

<p class="margin"> When Divya was a freshman at Stanford University she started spending over 80 hours a week researching stem cell therapies at the Stanford Stem Cell Institute. Two years and 17 publications later, at the age of 20, she dropped out to start Stem Cell Theranostics, the first drug screening company that uses disease-specific beating heart cells derived from human skin to perform the first "clinical trial in a dish". As a student entrepreneur in the medical industry she realized that lots of cutting-edge technologies weren't making it out of laboratories due to a fundamental lack of medical entrepreneurship education for scientists, especially due to the difficult medical commercialization landscape. </p>

<p class="margin"> Dr. Roxana Heitz graduated with her PhD from Stanford University in 2011, where her research focused on implantable electronics for biomedical applications. She obtained her MS from Stanford University in 2007 and BASc from Waterloo University in Canada in 2004. Throughout her undergraduate and graduate years, Roxana held different software and electrical engineering positions during internships at several tech companies in Canada and the Bay Area. </p>

<p class="margin"> Fletcher Wilson is currently CEO of InterVene, Inc., a medical device start-up, which he co-founded in late 2011 as a Stanford spin-out. InterVene has developed a minimally invasive technology to address deep vein valve failure caused by deep vein thrombosis. This disease leads to a life sentence of costly and painful venous stasis ulcers, and a successful solution represents a multi-billion dollar market opportunity. InterVene has raised $2M and currently resides in the Fogarty Institute for Innovation. It is important to note that InterVene (formerly Intimal Solutions) got one if its first big breaks by winning the grand prize at the Berkeley Business Plan Competition in 2011.</p>
