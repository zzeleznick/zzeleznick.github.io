Last entry I left you with a question to ponder…how do you cook in space when nothing wants to stay put.  We use gravity in so many ways during our daily lives and do not even realize it, like cooking, for example.  You gather your tools and ingredients and set them out on the counter or table or whatever your work surface is.  You mix things in the bowl, you pour liquids from one place to the other, you throw the dirty dishes in the sink and the food remnants in the trash.  All of this is possible because of gravity—everything stays where you put it.  One of the first challenges I had in my cooking adventures was how to manage all of the above. "

            "body": "It turns out that with duct tape (yep, the ubiquitous duct tape) and plastic bags you can do just about anything.  I have definitely been on a learning curve.  With each successive experiment I am getting less and less messy. (Note I am not saying I am getting more and more clean and orderly, just less messy!)  From day one, when I realized how useful and necessary plastic bags are to the cooking process I have been on the look out for the right size (and cleanliness) of plastic bags.  Fortunately the ground likes to send things up in plastic bags, as they are very useful for containing all kinds of things, and not just for cooking, so we have tons of them here and it was just a matter of sorting through them to find what I was looking for.  I started a stash and whenever we are doing an activity that liberates plastic bags I grab the promising ones and put them in my stash so I have them handy for the next cooking day. "

            "body": "I usually have one plastic bag as my main “bowl” and then use others for the cutting or any preparation work.  Also many of my starting foods are standard foods and come in their own pouches or packets.  At some point all of the ingredients have to be removed from their original packaging and end up in the main “bowl.”  This can be accomplished in several ways and again, it depends on the condition of the ingredients.  The easiest thing to do is cut the food packet along one side, and in this case cut the whole bag and do not leave a tab like we usually do (to avoid small pieces of bag floating away…leaving a bag with a tab allows you to only have one piece of garbage to deal with).  Then it is possible to simply turn the bag open side “down” into the plastic bag that is the main bowl and zip the bag closed such that there is no opening.  Then you can squeeze the contents from the one bag to the other.  This method works if there is a bit of liquid in the ingredient and the item does not consist of small chunks.  If the ingredient is in small chunks you just end up squeezing the food to the sides of its bag and nothing empties out into the plastic bag (not that this has happened or anything….). "

            "body": "If it is not possible to squeeze the ingredient out, the next option is to spoon it out.  This will work as long as the food is not too dry.  By the way, scrambled eggs and corn are nightmares to work with as they are small and do not have a lot of liquid inherent in them.  The corn likes to stick to everything, including the spoon, and the eggs are firm believers in entropy (they scatter everywhere!).  I had to play with how to make the cut in the plastic package these foods came in before I was finally able to do this in a not-too-messy of a fashion.   I got around the first issue, the food sticking to the spoon, by placing the spoon deep into the mixing “bowl” and using my hand from the outside to press each side of the plastic bag against the spoon, thus scraping off anything there.  Then it is necessary to very slowly remove the spoon.  To get the eggs to behave I mixed some of the sauce I was using, in the case of the crab salad, mayo, with the eggs while the eggs were still in their original package.  This gave the eggs some cohesiveness and they could be transferred as a lump into the mixing “bowl.”  I actually found that technique to work with any small, dry, loose particles.  Put the sauce with it, and then add them together to the main plastic bag for mixing. "

        "body": "The dishes I have made to date have had a high sauce content so they could then be easily eaten or moved around, OR, put on a tortilla.  If the dish needs re-heating, as some do, I put small portions in the foil bags as I mentioned earlier, seal them with duct tape, and put them in the U.S. food warmer, which takes flat pouches as opposed to cans.  Sometimes some liquid escapes in the food warmer and I have to clean that up, but overall it works well.  (For any NASA people reading this, I use disinfectant wipes followed by wet wipes to clean up the food warmer, so no worries!)So it is possible to cook in space with a few hours, lots of dry and wet wipes and the basic tools of duct tape, plastic bags, foil pouches, and a small knife.  It is fun and certainly an adventure!"
